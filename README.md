theHarvester is a simple to use, yet powerful tool designed to be used during the reconnaissance stage of a red
team assessment or penetration test. It performs open source intelligence (OSINT) gathering to help determine
a domain's external threat landscape. The tool gathers names, emails, IPs, subdomains, and URLs by using
multiple public resources that include:

Sublist3r is a python tool designed to enumerate subdomains of websites using OSINT. It helps penetration testers and bug hunters collect and gather subdomains for the domain they are targeting. Sublist3r enumerates subdomains using many search engines such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, Baidu and Ask. Sublist3r also enumerates subdomains using Netcraft, Virustotal, ThreatCrowd, DNSdumpster and ReverseDNS.
